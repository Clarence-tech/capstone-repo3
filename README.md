# Capstone Ransomware Project

## Project Synopsis

This repository supports my Capstone 698 project on ransomware detection and response.
It contains a small synthetic dataset, a one-step analysis script, and documentation that
shows how reproducible workflows can align with security standards such as NIST CSF 2.0.
SP 800-171 Rev.3, and SP 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture).
